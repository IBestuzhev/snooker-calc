# Snooker Calculator

Application allows you to calculate players score and remaining score on table.

If you run the app after several balls were potted you can use **Set Start data** screen to update the starting score.

There are some *limitations* now. 

* In **Set Start data** menu you can not specify that the next ball is coloured. So app will
always start with red ball as ball on. 
* Fauls where red was potted are not implemented. If such situtation happens you need to 
use *Start data* to reduce the number of reds
* Free Ball is always red. Faul situations on last stage (e.g. you have to pot brown and get snookered after faul) are not present.

If you have any suggestion on how to fix the limitations above or other bugreports or (*prefferable*) fixes - you can start an 
issue or pull request on [project's GitHub](https://github.com/IBestuzhev/snooker-calc)
